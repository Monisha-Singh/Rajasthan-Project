            description: `Kathputli, a traditional string puppet performance native to Rajasthani, is a key feature of village fairs, religious festivals, and social gatherings in Rajasthan. Some scholars believe the art of Kathputli to be more than thousands of years old.Mentions of Kathputli have been found in Rajasthani folk tales, ballads, and even folk songs. Similar rod puppets can be also found in West Bengal.
It is believed that Kathputli began as a string marionette art invented by the tribal Rajasthani Bhat community 1500 years ago. Rajasthani kings and nobles encouraged the art of Kathputli; over the last 500 years, Kathputli was supported by a system of patronage through kings and well-off families. Kathputli lovers would support artists in return for the artists singing praises of the patronsâ€™ ancestors. `,

            description: `Rajasthani cuisine is the cuisine of the Rajasthan region in North West India. It was influenced by various factors like the warlike lifestyles of its inhabitants, the availability of ingredients in an arid region and by Hindu temple traditions of sampradayas like Pushtimarg and Ramanandi. Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. Scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. Signature Rajasthani dishes include Dal Baati Churma, Panchratna Dal, Papad ro Saag, Ker Sangri,[3] Gatte ro Saag. It is also known for its snacks like Bikaneri bhujia, Mirchi bada and Kanda kachauri. Other famous dishes include Dal Baati, malaidar special lassi (lassi) and Lashun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), Mawa lassi from Jodhpur, Alwar ka mawa, Malpauas from Pushkar and rasgulla from Bikaner, "paniya"and "gheriya" from Mewar.` ,

While there are many Gupta and post-Gupta era temples in Rajasthan, after the 7th century, the architecture evolved into a new form called the Gurjara-Pratihara Style. Some famous temples of this style are temples at Osian, the Kumbhshyama temple of Chittor, temples at Baroli, the Somesvara temple at Kiradu, the Harshnath temple in Sikar, and the Sahasra Bahu temple of Nagda.
            From the 10th century to the 13th century, a new style of temple architecture was developed, known as the Solanki style or Maru-Gurjara style. The Samadhishwar temple at Chittor and the ruined temple at Chandravati are examples of this style.
            This period was also a golden period for Jain temples in Rajasthan.` ,
